                <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
                <p>At Haviliah Precious Gold International School, pupils are given the basic essential guidelines for student conduct on which they develop their own essential agreements within each class. This promotes students self-awareness in monitoring both their academic and behavioural issues. Our emphasis is on promoting good conduct, resulting in reduction and ideally disappearance of misbehaviour.</p>

              <h2>Attendance Policy</h2>
              <p>Your child’s attendance at school is very important. Our educational programme in the Primary school is solidly based on the assumption that pupils will attend school regularly, in accordance with the School calendar and the daily schedule. <br><br>Regular attendance is compulsory in order to fulfil the requirements and assignments in all subjects. Erratic attendance will inevitably impede the rate of progress, limit the student’s potential achievements and negatively affect his or her academic record. The student must be in class to progress.</p>

            <div class="purpose">
              <h2>Purpose of the Attendance Policy</h2>
              <p>It is intended that this policy, the implementation of which involves a collaborative effort on the part of the entire school community, that is students, parents, staff and the Board, gives clear, practical guidance as to the means of monitoring, maintaining and if necessary improving the levels of attendance expected, without exception, of every student.</p>
