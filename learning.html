                <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
                <p>At Havilah Precious Gold International School, pupils are given the basic essential guidelines for student conduct on which they develop their own essential agreements within each class. This promotes students self-awareness in monitoring both their academic and behavioural issues. Our emphasis is on promoting good conduct, resulting in reduction and ideally disappearance of misbehaviour.</p>

              <h2>Attendance Policy</h2>
              <p>Your child’s attendance at school is very important. Our educational programme in the Primary school is solidly based on the assumption that pupils will attend school regularly, in accordance with the School calendar and the daily schedule. <br><br>Regular attendance is compulsory in order to fulfil the requirements and assignments in all subjects. Erratic attendance will inevitably impede the rate of progress, limit the student’s potential achievements and negatively affect his or her academic record. The student must be in class to progress.</p>  
            </div>
            <div class="purpose">
              <h2>Purpose of the Attendance Policy</h2>
              <p>It is intended that this policy, the implementation of which involves a collaborative effort on the part of the entire school community, that is students, parents, staff and the Board, gives clear, practical guidance as to the means of monitoring, maintaining and if necessary improving the levels of attendance expected, without exception, of every student.</p>

              <h2>Absences</h2>
              <p>Students should therefore be absent only for necessary and important reasons, such as illness or family/personal emergency. Because of the inevitable toll on academic progress in particular, the school seeks willing co-operation from parents in exercising the utmost restraint in excusing their children from school.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="absences">
              <h2>Excused Absences</h2>
              <p>A student may be excusably absent from school due to personal illness, death in the family, emergency dental or medical treatment, religious holiday, procurement of essential documents, renewal of passports, or other vital reasons if approved in advance by the Principal. If at all possible, medical/dental appointments during school hours must be avoided.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="absences">
              <h2>Unexcused Absences</h2>
              <p>Unexcused absences include truancy, cutting/skipping a class, suspension, absences that have not been followed up with a note from parents, or other reasons not approved by the Principal. Work missed for such absences must be completed. Unexcused absences inevitably affect marks and report grades negatively.</p>
